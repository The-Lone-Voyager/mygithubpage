            <p>The university that I attend is Brescia University in Owensboro, KY. You can visit Brescia on the web by
            <a href="http://www.brescia.edu">clicking here.</a> Brescia is a small, catholic school located in Western Kentucky.
            I really enjoy the atmosphere here at Brescia. One of the reasons I chose to go here was because of the small size.
            There is a small student-to teacher ratio here at Brescia. This means that students can get to know their professors personally 
            which I enjoy.</p>
            <p>My major is computer science and my emphasis is in quantitative theory. This is essentially a math-centric computer science
            course of study. Janett Williams is my computer science professor and my advisor is the mathematics professor, Chris Tiahrt. I have a
            cumulative 3.9 total GPA and a 4.0 GPA in my major-only classes. Below I have posted a table of the classes I have taken in my major subject area showing the 
            amount of credits they are worth and my final grade in the course.</p>

            <p>Outside of class I also am a work-study student in the computer science department at Brescia. I work in the computer science lab on
                the fifth floor of the science building. This is a brand new lab which was just built in 2016. My duties include maintaining the lab,
                installing software, and helping students that need help with their computer science assignments, such as in programming. This is a great
                joy for me as I really like teaching programming to other students. My education here at Brescia has helped me to learn several programming
                languages such as C++, C#/.NET, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I have also learned about operating systems and artificial intelligence during
                my studies here at Brescia. Overall, Brescia is a great school and I'm glad that I chose to go here for my education.</p>
