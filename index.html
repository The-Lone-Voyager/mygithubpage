  <p>Hello, Welcome to my site! My name is Dakota Barron. I am a computer science student at Brescia University in Owensboro, Kentucky, USA.
          I have created this site in order to tell you a little bit more about me. I hope you will enjoy your experience on my site.</p>
    <p>I was born in Charleston, South Carolina in 1996 to Frank and Rebecca Barron. My mother is originally from New Jersey and my father
          is from South Carolina. My mother was a social worker and my dad was working on his cullinary degree from Johnson & Wales. I lived in
          Charleston until I was about 3 years old. I also have 2 younger sisters who were also born during that time in South Carolina.</p>
    <p>My parents then moved out to Branson, MO where we lived for 2 years. We then moved just south to Jonesboro, AR where I went to
          primary school 2nd-6th grade. This was a very memorable time in my life and I made some great friends there. I went to a Catholic
          school there and I will always remember the teachers and friends I met there. After 6th grade I then moved to Savannah, GA where I went
          to middle school (7th-8th grade). After that my family moved back to South Carolina but this time to the capitol city, Columbia. I went to
          9th and 10th grade there and then we moved once again to Hopkinsville, KY where I graduated from Christian County High School.</p>
          <p>After graduating from high school in 2014 I enrolled at Brescia University. My major is computer science and I am a Moore presidential scholar.
          I am currently a junior and I want to get involved with software development. You can check me out on GitHub by <a href="https://github.com/the-lone-voyager">clicking here</a></p>
