            <p>I like programming in my free time. I enjoy learning new programming languages and creating applications with the programming languages 
            that I learn. I currently am trying to master the C#/.NET platform, particularly Xamarin cross-platform mobile applications. You can find out more about Xamarin by <a href="https://www.xamarin.com/">clicking here</a> Upon graduation I 
            hope to become a software developer. I have not really given a lot of thought to exactly what sort of environment I would like to work in. Software 
            developers have many options. There are some software creators who freelance and then there are also those who work for a company on large teams. 
            It does not really matter for me and I would be happy in either position. I would prefer staying close to Owensboro, but I would also be open 
            to relocating to a different location depending on the job that I get.</p>

            <p>I have won many awards and recognitions during my time here at Brescia, here is a list of a few of them:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Honor's College Memberbership</li>
                <li>Moore Presidential Scholarship</li>
                <li>Outsanding Computer Science Student - Freshman Year</li>
                <li>Dean's List - Freshman Year</li>
                <li>Outstanding Computer Science Student - Sophmore Year</li>
                <li>Dean's List - Sophomore Year</li>
                <li>Outstanding Mathematics Student - Sophmore Year</li>
            </ul>

            <p>For my hobbies, I enjoy playing video games and hanging out with my friends. As far as video games go, I am a PC gamer and do not really play consoles. 
            I believe that PC gaming is the way to go because you can customize your machine to the way you want it and the graphics are also better than on consoles. 
            Another hobby of mine in my free time is anything having to do with Linux. I am a huge fan of UNIX-like operating systems, new and old. I enjoy finding old 
            UNIX-based systems at garage sales and thrift stores. Many people today prefer the GUI to the CLI but I myself am the other way around. I am at home in front 
            of a UNIX terminal with a command line interface. The command line just has so much power that the GUI lacks in my opinion.</p>
